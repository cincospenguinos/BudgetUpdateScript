# BudgetUpdateScript

I hacked this shitty little script together because I was tired of having to manually modify my transactions every time I downloaded them from my bank. Theoretically you can take any transaction data and export it as CSV and it'll handle it, but I don't know for sure. I don't really care. This is really just for me but I'm sharing it because people may want to use it.

Also I wrote this at like 4 in the morning on a Tuesday because I ordered decaf and the barista gave me a double shot of espresso instead. The bastard.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
